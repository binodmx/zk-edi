        Clusters the nodes represented by the adjacency matrix using spectral 
        clustering.

        Parameters:
        - adjacency_matrix: The adjacency matrix representing the graph 
        structure of the nodes to be clustered. It should be a square matrix 
        where each entry (i, j) represents the similarity between nodes i and j.
        - n_clusters: The number of clusters to form.

        Returns:
        - labels: An array of cluster labels assigned to each node based on 
        spectral clustering.
